## Task 1: Git Setup and Basic Mathematical Operations

To accomplish this task, we performed the following steps:

1. Initialized a Git repository.
2. Created Python functions for addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations.
3. Added proper commit messages for each function implementation.
4. Pushed the codes to the Git repository.

## Task 2: Creating Feature and Release Branches

For this task, we followed the Gitflow workflow and did the following:

1. Created a feature branch from the main branch.
2. Added a function in the previous script to calculate division and committed the changes.
3. Merged the feature branch back into the main branch using Gitflow.
4. Created a release branch from the main branch using Gitflow.

## Task 3: Implementing Pre-commit Hooks

In this task, we utilized local hooks and made the following progress:

1. Implemented a pre-commit hook script to verify the correctness of the email set in the repository and detect trailing whitespaces in the commits.
2. Incorporated a pre-commit hook with pre-built plugins to enhance hook management.
3. Added a commit-msg hook to check if the commit messages contain tags for commit types such as "feat", "fix", "refactor", etc.
